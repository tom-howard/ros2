title: Accessing or Installing ROS 2
description: "How to access ROS 2 on University Computers, or install it on your own."

In order to engage with [the ROS 2 Course](../course/README.md) you'll need access to a ROS environment. 

ROS can be a bit tricky to install, and is primarily supported on only a handful of *"Tier 1"* operating systems ([as listed here](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation.html){target="_blank"}), the first (and best) choice being Ubuntu Linux. In order to install or access ROS 2 for this course, we recommend one of the following options. Click on the relevant link below to access further details:

## WSL-ROS2 (Windows)

*University of Sheffield Staff/Students Only*

We've created our own custom ROS 2 (Jazzy) and Ubuntu (24.04) environment for WSL specifically for this course, which we call **"WSL-ROS2"**. The environment contains all the tools and ROS packages that you will need for the course exercises and assignments. 

**This is our recommended option**, and there are two ways to access this: 

1. [**Install it** on your own Windows 10 or 11 machine](./installing-wsl-ros2.md) via the IT Services Software Download Service.
1. [**Access it** on a range of managed desktop computers across the University campus](./using-wsl-ros/README.md).

## Mac & Linux

For Mac users, the best option for installing ROS 2 on your machine is by using Docker, but please note that performance is not optimal. 

The Docker option works *very well* on Linux.
