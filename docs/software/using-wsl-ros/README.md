title: Accessing WSL-ROS2 on University Computers
---

**Applicable to**: Students who do not have a Windows 10 or 11 personal computer.

## The WSL-ROS2 Simulation Environment

To support this course we've created a custom ROS 2 environment which runs on Windows 10 or 11 using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/){target="_blank"}. We call this "**WSL-ROS2**" and it is available on a range of managed desktop computers across the university campus. 

## In the Diamond {#diamond}

WSL-ROS2 is **pre-installed** on all machines in the following Computer Rooms in **the Diamond**:

* Computer Rooms 1, 2, 4 & 6
* Short Term Loan Laptops in Computer Room 5
* 40 dedicated *WSL-ROS laptops* (made available in Computer Room 5 during the COM2009 lab sessions)

## Other Campus Computer Rooms {#other}  

In addition to this, WSL-ROS2 can also be *installed* on all machines in the following additional Campus Computer Rooms (via Software Center):
