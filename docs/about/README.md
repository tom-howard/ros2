# About this Site

This is the home of ROS 2 course materials developed by [Tom Howard](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/engineering/diamond-engineering/our-staff/tom-howard){target="_blank"}. Tom is a University Teacher in the [Multidisciplinary Engineering Education (MEE) Team](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/engineering/diamond-engineering/about-us){target="_blank"} at the University of Sheffield.

These resources are designed to support a number of *practical robotics lab courses* run in **The Diamond**: 

* **Robotics** (COM2009): an undergraduate module for [The School of Computer Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cs){target="_blank"}
* **Mobile Robotics and Autonomous Systems** (ELE434): a masters-level Mechatronic and Robotic Engineering module in [The School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/eee){target="_blank"}
* **Industry 4.0** (AMR31001): A third-year module on [the AMRC Training Centre Degree Apprenticeship](https://amrctraining.co.uk/apprenticeships/degree-apprenticeships-level-6)

These courses are designed to teach students how to use ROS 2 (The Robot Operating System, Version 2) with TurtleBot3 Waffle robots, using a mix of simulation-based learning and real robot hardware. Most of the initial learning is done in simulation, after which students are able to apply their new-found ROS 2 knowledge to our [real TurtleBot3 Waffle Robots](./robots.md).
