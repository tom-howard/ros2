* [Part 1: Getting Started with ROS 2](./part1.md)

    *Learn the basics of ROS 2 and become familiar with some key tools and principles, allowing you to program robots and work with ROS 2 applications effectively.*

* [Part 2: Odometry & Navigation](./part2.md)

    *Learn about Odometry, which informs us of a robot's position and orientation in an environment. Apply both open and closed-loop velocity control methods to a Waffle.*

* [Part 3: Beyond the Basics](./part3.md)

    *Execute ROS applications more efficiently using launch files, and learn how to affect the behaviour of nodes during run-time using parameters. Learn about the LiDAR sensor, the data that it generates, and see the benefits of this for tools like "SLAM".*

* [Part 4: Services](./part4.md)

    *Learn about an alternative way that ROS nodes can communicate across a ROS network, and the situations where this might be useful.*

* [Part 5: Actions](./part5.md)

    *Learn about another key ROS communication method which is similar to a ROS Service, but with a few key benefits and alternative use-cases.*

* [Part 6: Cameras, Machine Vision & OpenCV](./part6.md)

    *Learn how to work with images from a robot's camera. Learn techniques to detect features within these images, and use this to inform robot decision-making.*
