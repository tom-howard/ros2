description: "An individual simulation-based course to teach you all about ROS 2"

## Overview

This is a 6-part course, designed to teaching you all about ROS 2 and how to use it. The course is designed to be completed in simulation, so you will therefore need access to a ROS 2 installation which can either be installed on your own machine, or accessed on a range of managed computers across the University of Sheffield campus. [See here for more information on how to access or install ROS 2](../software/README.md).

Each part of the course comprises a series of step-by-step instructions and exercises to teach you how ROS works, and introduces you to the core principles of the framework. The exercises give you the opportunity to see how to apply these principles to practical robotic applications. Completing this course (either in part or in full) will provide you with the necessary skills for [working with our real TurtleBot3 Waffle robots](../waffles/README.md) in the Diamond.
